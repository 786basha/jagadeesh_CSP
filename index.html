                    <p>Crop rotation is an agricultural practice that involves systematically changing the type of crops grown in a particular field over time. It is based on the principle that different crops have varying nutrient requirements and interact with the soil in different ways. Crop rotation offers several benefits for both plant health and soil fertility</p>
